        I am a native Los Angeleno. Since I was a small child I've long to create. I knew that I wanted to be a photographer. All of the photographs I took as a child have been lost to time. As an adult I've been publish a few times. I'm far from sucecssful and good at 
        what I do. I can't give up photography even if I wanted to, I could 
        never stop taking pictures. The photo-journalist in me loves shoot street photography. Capturing real momments as they happen. The Dude in me loves capturing artistic nudes, in the studio and in nature.
        Today I'm working on becoming a <strong>Front-End Web Developer.</strong>
