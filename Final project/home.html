        Thank you for having a look at my work. This is a small mix of the photos that I take. I majored in photo-journalism at Los Angeles Valley College. And I've worked for celebirty photographers Jerry Avenaim and Jeff Katz, Bret Ratner. I've shot fashion and musical artist. For the moment I'm shooting artistic nudes. Check out my Instagram Hippie with a Gun to see a varity of my work.
